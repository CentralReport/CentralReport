    - Improvement #87: New host module and fixed memory collector for OS X 10.9 Mavericks

        * The memory collector works well on OS X 10.9, with the memory compression

--------------------------------------------------------------
Version Alpha 0.3.0 (November 4th, 2013)

    - Feature #58: CentOS distributions Support

    - Feature #67: Travis CI and silent installer/uninstaller
        * Travis CI performs a Continuous Integration to ensure
          your codebase is never broken.
          (https://travis-ci.org/CentralReport/CentralReport)
        * New "-s" argument for the installer and the uninstaller scripts
          When it used, tasks are fully automated, no user interactions required.
          All confirmations are validated by default.
          Useful to perform tests or for deployments.

    - Feature #70: New online installer and uninstaller
        * Install and uninstall CentralReport with a single line in a terminal.
          One remote script is available for the installer and another one for
          the uninstaller. They are in charge to automatically download the related
          package and they are handling the magic for you.

    - Feature #82: New CLI Manager
        * A friendly way to modify the CentralReport configuration with
          interactive menus and checkboxes in the user terminal. No need
          to modify the configuration file manually!
          Can be used with the command "centralreport manager".
        * Called during the installation to ask to user the basic
          configuration, like the port for the interal web server. Not started
          when using the '-s' parameter (silent installation).

    - Improvement #72: Added a check for the webserver port availability
        * When the chosen port is already in use on the current host,
          the webserver isn't started and an error is logged.

    - Improvement #74: Bash functions cleaned
        * Removed unneeded code
        * Improved some variables

    - Fix #73: Removed old config.py script

    - Fix #79: Removed support for Python 2.5 and older

    - Fix #81: Removed flot.js library and 'dashboard_mac' template

    - Fix #84: Fixed "sudo -n" and "sudo -v" for OS X Mavericks

          (CentralReport can be managed with the "centralreport" command in
