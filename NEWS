Version Alpha 0.3.0 (Not released yet)
    Currently in development

    - Feature #67: Travis CI and silent installer/uninstaller
        * Travis CI performs a Continuous Integration to ensure
          your codebase is never broken.
          (https://travis-ci.org/CentralReport/CentralReport)
        * New "-s" argument for the installer and the uninstaller scripts
          When it used, tasks are fully automated, no user interactions required.
          All confirmations are validated by default.
          Useful to perform tests or for deployments.

    - Improvement #72: Added a check for the webserver port availability
        * When the chosen port is already in use on the current host,
          the webserver isn't started and an error is logged.
