Version Alpha 0.2.0 (not released yet)
    In development

    - #25: Improved install and uninstall
            * All lines in the console doesn't exceed 80 columns width
              (bash and config.py)
            * Added default values in config.py script
            * Added new "lightbox" feature to display beautiful messages in bash

    - #27: Added "cr.system" module
        * Added function to execute system commands with subprocess.Popen.
          Now, all commands are parsed before execution and are cut if necessary.
          For example, you can write: system.execute_command('ls -l | grep toto')
          directly, without cutting this command to many subcommands.

    - #30: Updated Bootstrap from 2.2.1 to 2.3.0

    - #33: Improved log functions

          one logging function
        * Added support for rotating log files. Each log files can't exceed 5 MB,
          and we retain a single backup.
