Version Alpha 0.2.0 (not released yet)
    In development

    - [WIP] Webservices

    - [WIP] Improved install dev tools

    - [WIP] PEP 8 refactors

    - Added "cr.system" module
        * Added function to execute system commands with subprocess.Popen.
          Now, all commands are parsed before execution and are cut if necessary.
          For example, you can write: system.execute_command('ls -l | grep toto')
          directly, without cutting this command to many subcommands.

    - Improved install and uninstall
        * All lines in the console doesn't exceed 80 columns width
          (bash and config.py)
        * Added default values in config.py script
        * Added new "lightbox" feature to display beautiful messages in bash

    - Improved log functions
        * Python Logger is now automatically configured on the first call of
          one logging function
        * Added support for rotating log files. Each log files can't exceed 5 MB,
          and we retain a single backup.

    - Updated Bootstrap from 2.2.1 to 2.3.0

    - And... added this changelog :-)
