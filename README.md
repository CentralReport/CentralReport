# CentralReport

**Central Report is designed to monitor very easily computers and servers, and runs on many current operating systems.**

Right now, CentralReport monitors :

* CPU
* Physical Memory (RAM)
* Virtual Memory (Swap)
* Load Average
* Uptime
* Disks

**It's developed by three students : @Guimove, @Ninir and @miniche. It's only the beginning : we have many ideas for CentralReport and others exciting and related projets.**

## The idea

We have many ideas to simplify server monitoring:

* Very simple installation (one line in a terminal)
* Cross platform (Unix, Linux, Windows)
* Standalone or Cloud conception
* Alerts (mobile push, mail, etc.)
* Highly customizable dashboard
* Plugins support
* For public or Pros
