# CentralReport

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CentralReport/CentralReport.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CentralReport/CentralReport)

**CentralReport is a lightweight tool for monitoring your computer or your server.**

Right now, CentralReport monitors:

* CPU
* Physical Memory (RAM)
* Virtual Memory (Swap)
* Load Average
* Uptime
* Disks

## The idea

We have many ideas to simplify server monitoring:

* A lightweight tool built in Python, helped by Bash scripts
* Very simple installation (one line in a terminal)
* Cross platform (**Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS and Mac OS X**)
* A simple web server
* A standard JSON API to retrieve host data and the lastest check

## Install or Uninstall CentralReport

Please visit the [Wiki installation page](http://docs.centralreport.net/unix-agent/install) to get the procedure depending on your system.
